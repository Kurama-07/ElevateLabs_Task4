SQL Aggregate Functions and Grouping (Task 4)

ðŸš€ Objective

Practice and understand SQL aggregate functions and grouping using SUM, COUNT, AVG, MAX, GROUP BY, and HAVING to summarize and analyze tabular data for interviews and real-world SQL skills.

ðŸ“‹ What I Did

Created a sample Employee table with emp_id, name, department, salary, and age columns.

Inserted test data to analyze using aggregation.

Wrote and tested multiple SQL queries to:

Calculate total salary in the company.

Compute average salary per department.

Count employees per department.

Filter departments with average salary > 60000.

Find the highest salary in each department.

Calculate rounded average age per department.

Count the number of distinct departments.

ðŸ“œ Files Included

aggregate_queries.sql - Contains all the SQL queries and sample data creation for local practice in DB Browser for SQLite / MySQL Workbench.

ðŸ’¡ Key Concepts Practiced

âœ… Aggregate functions: SUM, COUNT, AVG, MAX, ROUNDâœ… GROUP BY for categorizing dataâœ… HAVING vs WHERE for filtering groupsâœ… Counting distinct valuesâœ… Real interview SQL practice for data summarization
